## Add Google CSE

After your site has been up for awhile, [Google Custom Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/) can provide a quality search of your content.
To add one to your collection site, visit CSE, set up the search, then copy the code snippet into this project.

- Log in with a Gmail account at <https://cse.google.com/cse/>
- The main page will display any CSE you have already set up. Click the "Add" button to create a new one.
- Paste the full github url of your collection site followed by a wild card (`*`) in the "Sites to search" box, for example `username.github.io/repository/*`.
- Give the CSE a meaningful name, then click "Create".
- Click "Control panel" to customize.
- Click "Look and feel" on the left side menu.
- On the Layout tab, choose "Full width", then click "Save"
- On the Themes tab, choose and "Minimalist", then click "Save & Get Code"
- On the Get code page, copy the code snippet and paste into `includes/google-site-search.html` (replacing the full content).
